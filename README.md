To run the data viewer:

0. Make a folder called `static`

1. Drag into the `static` folder, your folder, and name it `result` (we are referring to the folder containing all the images etc we want to view). Make sure to delete the previous `result` folder if you want to use a new `result` folder. Your directory should be:

`root/static/result/`, where `result` is your folder of data.

2. do `python view_data.py`

3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
